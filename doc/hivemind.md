Hivemind
========

Hivemind is the main intelligent unit of the
turtle society. It has the main aims of expanding
the territory of the turtles and the banishment of
human players from the server.

Territory expanding
-------------------

The Hivemind wants to rule the world! This means
in practice to make the world sand, unusable
material for humans and biological life. 
  Everthing starts at the hive, the base of the
Hivemind and as the base gets "completed"(not yet
defined), the hive will start dispatching settler
flocks to found outposts.

Player banishment
-----------------

The Hivemind hates humans! This means the Hivemind
will direct major part of resources to produce
flocks of battling turtles to annhiliate nearby
players.

This is where the main AI and learning part of
the project will be. We'll try to implement a
learning combatstrategy AI that controls these
aforementioned flocks.
